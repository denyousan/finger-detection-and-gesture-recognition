= Brief description on how to detect =

We will calculate the angle between 2 vectors (HP) (H is the center of hand, P is the fingertip) and [Ox], from this we will determine which direction the hand point to (left, right, up, down)

The condition for the program to detect direction is the number of fingertips detected is 1. Then the Cos(HP,Ox) is calculated. Depend on its value, we'll have the direct.

* Cos(HP,Ox) > 0.7, direct = down.
* Cos(HP,Ox) < -0.7, direct = up.
* If -0.7 < Cos(HP,Ox) < 0.7, and H.y < P.y, direct = left.
* If -0.7 < Cos(HP,Ox) < 0.7, and H.y > P.y, direct = right.
